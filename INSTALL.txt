Important note: If you plan on exposing the server to networks outside of your home network. Make sure you have a static IP address and have properly port forwarded port 8733 for TCP,
port 15001 for UDP and port 15010 for TCP. For multiple games you should port forward 15001 through 150010+x, where x is amount of games for UDP and TCP respectively. 
Furthermore even when testing on local network, make sure that the firewall is OFF or has a rule allowing BoDServer.exe through. Otherwise clients will not be able to connect.
By default Windows should ask if you want to allow BoDServer.exe through the firewall when running it the first time.
If only running on localhost, none of these changes must be made. We recommend testing the server on localhost due to this. 

This guide will assist in setting up an environment from which to host the Ball of Duty server.
For requirements see README.md.
1.  Install .NET Framework.
2.  Install Microsoft SQL Server.
3.  Run Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
4.  Click "New Query" on the toolbar.
5.  Copy the text from "BodServer.sql" found in the "Project Ball of Duty/Executables/Server" folder.
6.  Paste the sql code into the query window and click the red exclamation mark "Execute" on the toolbar.
7.  The window should now show a pane in which it says "Command(s) completed succesfully.".
8.  Open "Ball of Duty Server.exe.config" found in the "Project Ball of Duty/Executables/Server/Release".
9.  Refer to steps 14 through 18 in the setup for development below.
10. Run "Ball of Duty.exe" as administrator.


This guide will assist in setting up an environment from which to develop on the Ball of Duty server.
For requirements see README.md.

1.  Install Visual Studio and .NET Framework.
2.  Install Microsoft SQL Server.
3.  Run Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
4.  Setup a database named BoDServer or choose a name of your liking. Note this must be set in the connectionString later on, the default is BoDServer.
5.  Run Visual Studio as administrator.
6.  Open "Ball of Duty Server.sln".
7.  Find the "Persistence" folder. Open DataModel.edmx.
8.  Right click on the drawing surface and choose "Generate Database from Model...".
9.  In the pop up window type in your database server name in the "Server Name" field. In the repository owner's case it is "LUQJENSEN".
10. If the server name is legit, a database can now be selected in the drop down menu in the "Select or enter a database name" field. Choose BoDServer or the name you picked earlier. Click Ok.
11. A new window should pop up showing a preview of the SQL file that will be generated. Choose Finish.
12. In the topleft corner of the newly created DataModel.edmx.sql file locate a green arrow. Click the arrow. Note you may be prompted to login to your database server.
13. The window should now show a pane in which it says "Command(s) completed succesfully.".
14. Find "App.config" in the "Ball of Duty Server" project.
15. Find <appsSettings> and change the value of "serverIp" to the IP on which you want to expose the service and server.
16. Find <identity> and set the value of "dns" to the same IP as above.
17. Find <baseAddresses> and change the baseAddress field to match the IP set above. Eg. http://IP:8733/Ball_of_Duty_Server/Services/BoDService/

	The default IP is localhost. Which makes for the folliwing 3 properties:
	17.1. <appSettings>
           <add key="serverIp" value="localhost" />
	      </appSettings>
	17.2. <identity>
           <dns value="localhost" />
          </identity>
	17.3. <baseAddresses>
           <add baseAddress="http://localhost:8733/Ball_of_Duty_Server/Services/BoDService/" />
          </baseAddresses>
	   
18. Find <connectionStrings> and change the value connectionString, so that the properties "data source" matches your database server name and "initial catalog" matches your database name.

	The default connectingstring is "metadata=res://*/Persistence.DataModel.csdl|res://*/Persistence.DataModel.ssdl|res://*/Persistence.DataModel.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;data source=LUQJENSEN;initial catalog=BoDServer;integrated security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework&quot;"
	
19. Compile and run the server.
