This guide will assist in setting up an environment from which to develop on the Ball of Duty server.
For requirements see README.md.

1. Install Visual Studio and .NET Framework.
2. Install Microsoft SQL Server.
3. Setup a database named BoDServer or choose a name of your liking. Note this must be set in the connectionString later on, the default is BoDServer.
4. Run Visual Studio as administrator.
5. Open "Ball of Duty Server.sln".
6. Find the "Persistence" folder. Open DataModel.edmx.
7. Right click on the drawing surface and choose "Generate Database from Model...".
8. In the pop up window type in your database server name in the "Server Name" field. In the repository owner's case it is "LUQJENSEN".
9. If the server name is legit, a database can now be selected in the drop down menu in the "Select or enter a database name" field. Choose BoDServer or the name you picked earlier. Click Ok.
10. A new window should pop up showing a preview of the SQL file that will be generated. Choose Finish.
11. In the topleft corner of the newly created DataModel.edmx.sql file locate a green arrow. Click the arrow. Note you may be prompted to login to your database server.
12. The window should now show a pane in which it says "Command(s) completed succesfully.".
13. Find "App.config" in the "Ball of Duty Server" project.
14. Find <appsSettings> and change the value of "serverIp" to the IP on which you want to expose the service and server.
15. Find <identity> and set the value of "dns" to the same IP as above.
16. Find <baseAddresses> and change the baseAddress field to match the IP set above. Eg. http://IP:8733/Ball_of_Duty_Server/Services/BoDService/

	The default IP is localhost. Which makes for the folliwing 3 properties:
	16.1. <appSettings>
           <add key="serverIp" value="localhost" />
	      </appSettings>
	16.2. <identity>
           <dns value="localhost" />
          </identity>
	16.3. <baseAddresses>
           <add baseAddress="http://localhost:8733/Ball_of_Duty_Server/Services/BoDService/" />
          </baseAddresses>
	   
17. Find <connectionStrings> and change the value connectionString, so that the properties "data source" matches your database server name and "initial catalog" matches your database name.

	The default connectingstring is "metadata=res://*/Persistence.DataModel.csdl|res://*/Persistence.DataModel.ssdl|res://*/Persistence.DataModel.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string=&quot;data source=LUQJENSEN;initial catalog=BoDServer;integrated security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework&quot;"
	
18. Compile and run the server.
